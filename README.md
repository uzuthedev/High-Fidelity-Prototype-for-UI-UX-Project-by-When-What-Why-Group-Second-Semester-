Problem Description
Many people grapple with the daily struggle of choosing what to wear, which can result in lateness for work, appointments, and other commitments. This constant decision-making process can be overwhelming and time-consuming, causing frustration and stress. This common dilemma highlights the importance of finding a solution that simplifies outfit selection; reducing the burden on people and helping them manage their time more effectively. 
User Groups
Group 1: Students 
Students will benefit from our application because it will allow them to reduce or remove the social stresses that come from how they present themselves to their peers. This user group is constantly bombarded with new fashion trends which makes it hard and time-consuming to keep up. Our application will alleviate this by providing them with a system to store and generate new outfits. 

Demographics:
●	Age: 14-25 years old
●	Gender: Either 
●	Education: Actively enrolled at any level
●	Occupation: May or may not be actively working

Psychographics:

Media Consumption and Consumption Behavior: This group of users are likely to consume a vast and diverse source of media but fashion is a frequent subject across different genres of entertainment. From YouTubers selling merch to flexing high-end clothes in music, our users are sure to engage in fashion in the media in some way. This may influence what our users decide to wear and what clothes they want to purchase. This also opens a lot of opportunities for advertising and sponsorships

Goals and Motivations: Motivated to improve their time management, social standing and stress-related mental health. Automating the outfit selection process would reduce or remove the anxiety generated by having to select an outfit for themselves. The generation of user-preferred outfits provides the user with more self-esteem and confidence as they will be comfortable with their daily appearance. This would have a beneficial impact on their overall social standing and mental well-being which is important to this demographic.

Digital Proficiency: These users are likely to be proficient in digital technology or more specifically, smartphones and their mobile apps. This group will be able to easily understand new applications, however, due to their level of proficiency they’ll be more tuned to identify flaws like bugs, poorly designed UI and an obtrusive UX. This group is also more likely to prefer apps with auto-generated content and minimal UI elements similar to TikTok.

Group 2: Young Professionals
Young professionals will benefit from our application because it will allow them to remove a minor or major chore from their busy lives. Our app will provide them with a way to automate a recurring process that’ll enhance their ability to manage their time and prioritize tasks. 

Demographics:

●	Age: 20-39 years old
●	Gender: Either 
●	Education: Achieved a high-school diploma or better
●	Occupation: Actively working in a casual dress environment (e.g., school)

Psychographics:


Lifestyle: These users will have a busy lifestyle or a lifestyle that leaves them with little time for deciding or planning outfits (oversleeping, early work, on-call, etc.). Considering this, saving every minute of time will be crucial for these users. They would want an app that can maximize time efficiency.

Interests and Hobbies: These users are looking to incorporate regular sports and fitness routines and other leisure activities into their busy daily schedules. Whether it's early morning workouts, concerts, live events, travel, or weekend sports having to balance these extra activities is a daunting challenge. This group is likely to prefer automation as any tasks that can be simplified allow them to be more productive. Our app will help them quickly find suitable attire for their active lifestyle

Digital Proficiency: These users are likely to be proficient in digital technology, however, the level of comfort with new applications will vary as most in this group don’t have the time to stay up with the latest trends. Considering that the primary purpose of this application would be to provide convenience, their ideal app is likely to be one that is familiar and easily integrates with their life. This group is also more likely to prefer apps with clear and distinct UI elements similar to YouTube or Facebook.
User Research
Interview Plan
Before the interview, the interviewee will be sent an introduction survey to collect their background data (e.g., name, age, occupation, etc.). The interviewer will begin by introducing themselves, before providing a brief overview of the purpose of the interview, the project and details on the application. Following the introduction, the interviewer will ask a series of pre-determined probing, lifestyle, and application feature set questions. During the interview, the interviewer will ask follow-up questions to gain further insight from the interviewee. The interviewer will conclude with closing questions to gauge the interviewee’s interest in the app and potential must-have features. 

Where: The interview will be conducted in a location that would give the participant enough time to respond to all of the questions, accurately and independently. This could be done at the interviewee’s house, a coffee shop, SAIT, etc. Ideally, it will be conducted in person, however, if the participant is unable to attend in person, a video call will be used instead.

How Long: The interview should take 20-40 minutes, including the time it takes to elaborate on a question or ask a follow-up question.

Number of Participants: Five to ten participants will be interviewed. Additional interviews will be scheduled as needed (postponed/cancelled interviews, unusable responses, etc.).

Type of Interview: Interviews will utilize a semi-structured interview format to allow for follow-up or interviewee-specific questions.

Observation Plan
The observation will collect data on the participant's typical outfit selection process. This will provide information on their daily routine, style, and potential pain points. It will be held after the interview to assess the participant's process with additional context and identify potential barriers they may have overlooked during the interview. 

Where: Ideally, the interview would be at their home so the observation could be where they can access their wardrobe. This would allow them to get into their normal routine, providing us with accurate observation data. If this is not possible, we will adjust the location to a large clothing store so they can showcase their style and outfit selection.

When: The observation will be conducted following the interview, either directly after or at a specified later date. 

How Long: The observation should last about 20-35 minutes. This includes the time it takes to elaborate on task requirements and record their process.

Number of Participants: The number of participants is dependent on the number of people who are interviewed.

Tasks: 
1.	Get the participant to pick an outfit for the day and explain their thought process for picking it out.
2.	Choose an outfit for a warm/cold day and explain why you chose that outfit.
3.	Choose an outfit for a job or special event and explain why you chose it.
4.	Show me two to four items (e.g., shirt, pants, shorts, etc.) that best represent your style and explain that style in more detail. 
5.	Are there any apps (Weather App, Pinterest, etc.) that you use to pick out your clothes? Can you walk me through how you use them? 
Try It Yourself
Method
To begin the observation, the selected team member started planning his outfit right after waking up. He looked to see what pants he had available to base his outfit on. After deciding on a light pair of jeans, he checked the temperature for the day.  Since the day was forecast to be quite hot, he decided to go for just an earth-tone t-shirt. He stated that if it was colder, he would have layered a plain white undershirt with an overshirt or flannel.

Findings
It was found that the team member’s experience was fairly similar to the interviewees. One major thing he noticed while completing the interview and observing himself is that the observation questions were quite difficult to answer, specifically finding 3 items to represent his style. Despite this difficulty presented by the question, the information delivered seems to be a valuable insight into the users’ preferences. The “try it yourself” method, highlighted the importance of this question as could be used to great effect in the app itself as an introductory question to allow the algorithm to match the user with outfit suggestions.
Main Findings
External Functionality/API 
Description:
This would be the app’s integration with other services/applications like weather APIs, social platforms, online shopping sites, etc. This would include features that would connect to an external service to enhance user experience.

Findings:

Weather Integration
Users would prefer to have the app sync to an external weather API. They highlighted the desire to have the app provide outfit recommendations based on the current and forecasted conditions. This would allow the app to select weather-appropriate clothing. The other option was to include a weather element in the app that gave real-time information. This gave the user the option to see the day’s weather without having to open another app.

Social Media Integration
Users expressed interest in being able to share their outfits on social media or with friends either through the app itself or through external social media platforms like Instagram.

Shopping Suggestions
The app could connect with online clothing stores to suggest new clothing items based on users’ tastes and existing wardrobes. Interviewees shared that they would be more inclined to make purchases through the app if they were able to create outfits and then purchase the items for that outfit at a later date. 
User Issues/Accessibility 
Description:
This addresses challenges and barriers that users face when fusing the app, as well as features that would help make the app more accessible and user-friendly for a diverse audience.

Findings:
Ease of Use
Users want a simple interface, especially if the main purpose of the app is convenience. For example, having the app have preset (favourite) outfits can make it easy to access them when the user is in a rush. Having relevant tabs and categories on the app can help further with achieving this user preference.

Adding Items to the User’s Wardrobe
It seems like uploading photos could be more convenient/accurate, however, feedback from interviews highlighted that it should not be the only option. Giving the user the ability to select from a catalogue would enhance the user experience, allowing them to pick the option that is more convenient/applicable for them.

Outfit Based on Occasion
Some outfits might be easier to generate than others. For example, for work, there might be fewer clothes that can be matched compared to a date night, thus, this can result in a longer time to pick out the outfit. It would be crucial for the app to have good pairings so that the user doesn’t have to shuffle through a bunch of different options, resulting in tardiness. 

Importance of App
The importance of the app will be determined primarily by who the user is. If it is someone who does not struggle with picking out their outfit or does not care as much about what they wear, the importance will be much lower compared to someone who struggles with picking out their clothes every day. 
Primary App Features: Must-haves
Description:
These contain the core functionalities that would directly address the main needs and preferences of users. These would be essential features that are required for the app to serve its primary purpose.

Findings:

Notification Settings
Having the app send you notifications (like in the morning) and telling you what clothes to wear based on the weather can be very helpful in allowing the user to figure out their outfit for the day.

Recommendation of Relevant Outfits
The app should allow the user to pick styles and have the app suggest relevant pairings based on weather, occasion, and user preferences. In addition, the user should be able to swap singular clothing items while keeping the others in their outfit. Interviewees highlighted that the lack of these features or having these features operate at a sub-par level would lead to them deleting the app. 

Simple Interface
Having relevant and proper tabs/categories would enhance the user experience by making toggling through the app seamless. If it is going to be an app that users will frequently open then it has to meet this requirement. 

Calendar Feature
The user would be able to set an outfit for each day of the week, giving them the ability to plan out their outfits ahead of time. This feature would give the user the ability to separate their work outfits from their personal ones.  A calendar layout would provide an overview of the selected outfits for each day of the week. This was an example of a more productivity feature that interviewees were interested in over a purely fashion based one. 
Secondary Features: Nice-to-haves
Description:
These would be additional functionalities that would enhance the user experience but are not essential for the app’s primary purpose.

Findings:

Laundry Management
Have the app track which clothes are clean or dirty so that it does not suggest outfits with clothes that have already been worn and are no longer available.

Keep Track of Most/Least Worn Items
Having the app keep track of this would allow it to suggest better outfits. It would also provide the user with greater insight into the items in their closets. They may have clothing items that they never wear but are taking up space so this feature would act as a closet manager.

Visualize the Outfit
Have a feature which would allow the user to see how the outfit would look in a virtual environment like augmented reality or on a video game character. 
Conclusion
Initially, our app was primarily focused on fashion, however, its concept evolved after interviews and observations revealed users' interest in productivity features. One example of said feature was a weekly outfit planner that tracks daily outfits, providing an overview of the week's choices. Thus, while the core issue remained to help users choose what to wear and avoid lateness, we discovered the need for features like calendar integration and others such as quick outfit selection, wardrobe categorization, and virtual try-ons. Ultimately, multiple interviews and observations provided a more accurate understanding of user needs, shifting our focus from just fashion to a more practical, integrated app.
Empathy Map
 
User Need Statements
1. Alex, a full-time waitress, needs the app to display recommended outfits quickly upon opening because she sometimes runs late and needs quick outfit suggestions without additional steps.
a.	This information was gathered based on Roman’s interview with Alex where she specified that if she is running late, she does not want to complete a quiz first to pick out an outfit as time would be of the essence.

2. Gabe is a full-time barista who needs a way to quickly put together an outfit when in a hurry and find new clothes because struggling with an outfit has caused them to be late for work and they find they wear the same few clothes over and over again.
a. This information was gathered from Mace’s interview with Gabe where they mentioned they often struggle to pick out outfits when they’re behind schedule and find they just wear the same few comfy clothes without branching out.

3. Kennedy is a busy teacher who needs a way to simplify her outfit selection to avoid being late for work and social events while removing a frequent stressor from her work week.
a.	This information was gathered from the interview and observation Davonte conducted with Kennedy. She noted that picking her daily outfit is one of her least favourite parts of the day as it causes anxiety that can result in her being late to work or social events. As a teacher, she has a demanding schedule so automating her daily outfits for the week would allow her to be more productive. 

4. Rang, a busy professional woman, needs an efficient way to quickly choose stylish and weather-appropriate outfits each day to balance her professional appearance and comfort.
a.	This information was gathered during the interview and observation Nasratullah conducted with Rang. Her current method of selecting outfits is time-consuming and occasionally stressful, impacting her morning routine and confidence, especially when trying to consider the weather and her busy schedule.

5. Rod, a full-time student at SAIT whose days are filled with academic responsibilities, leaving little time to select an outfit, especially for special events. He needs a quicker and more effective way of planning his outfits to save him valuable time and allow him to focus on his school work. 
a.	This information was gathered during the interview and observation Confidence conducted with Rod. He noted that picking his daily outfits is something he does not want to spend a lot of time on and he doesn't  know how to pick the right outfit for different occasions . 
6. Alex, a full-time waitress needs the app to learn her style preferences and suggest combinations that she likes as she often struggles choosing between outfits and wants personalized outfit combinations.
a.	This information was gathered during the interview with her, as she indicated that she has to choose between 3-5 different outfits before finally deciding which one she wants to wear. This greatly increases the time it takes for her to pick out an outfit.

Activity Questions & Responses
1. Working in your teams, discuss the following questions:
a.	How will you recruit people to participate in your interviews? (Think about where your
primary user spends their time)
-	The people who are selected for our interviews should be people who care about their daily appearance. These individuals would be the target demographic as they would become our primary user base. The impact of one’s daily outfit selection can vary from a minor inconvenience to a major barrier to productivity. Interviewing these individuals will ensure that the responses we gather are accurate and detail-rich. 

b.	How many people do you think you can reasonably interview? (You should have at
least one per group member)
-	Reasonably, one per person. However, if an interviewee’s responses do not provide an adequate level of detail, then an additional person will be interviewed.

c.	How will you conduct the interview? (Online video chat, phone call, in person, etc.
Think about the benefits and drawbacks of each option)
-	Our interviews will be conducted in person to limit the amount of potential distractions and provide both parties with the best ability to connect. The downside of in-person interviews is that they require a high level of time commitment which can delay or postpone the interview. If we are unable to schedule an in-person interview then we will switch to an online video call interview. The benefit of a video call is that it requires less of a time commitment as it can be done almost anywhere. The two downsides of this method are that the environment that the interviewee is in could be full of distractions and a stable connection is required which may not be possible in all locations.

d.	 What will your interview process be? (Think about what a participant will experience
from the time they see your recruitment information to the time the interview
concludes. Also think about what YOU need to do to get them to the point of seeing
your recruitment information and what you need to do after the interview is finished.
Coming up with a list of steps can be very helpful here and you’ll also be able to use
this in your assignment!)
-	Step 1: Provide information to the interviewee about the project and what function the app seeks to accomplish
-	Step 2: Ask the interviewee the set of questions, going from introductory to more specific regarding the functionality of the app
-	Step 3: If the interviewee is comfortable and has time, get them to do the observation tasks right after
-	Step 4: Thank the interviewee for their time, conclude with reiterating what the plans for the app are, and inform them that they’ll be updated with any info and progress. 

e.	 What are some example questions you could ask during the interview? (Remember
you’re trying to understand what the users do, say, think, and feel)
-	How long does it take for you to pick out an outfit? - Think
-	How often do you struggle when deciding what to wear in the morning? - Feel
-	What features would you want most in a wardrobe app? - Say
-	Get the interviewee to pick an outfit for the day and explain their thought process for picking it out, including any applications they may use. - Do

f.	What problems do you foresee happening during this part of your project? For each
problem you identify, how could you deal with the issue (multiple solutions is great
here)?
-	Difficulty in coordinating schedules that are mutually convenient for the interviews and observations. To overcome this we plan to offer flexible scheduling options and different forms of connecting with participants (i.e. in-person or video call).
-	Receiving incomplete or inconsistent data during the interview and observation. To address this we are preparing a standardized list of questions for the interview that all interviewers will ask. The questions have been structured in a way that provides the interviewer with the ability to tailor each question to the participant and ask follow-up questions. 
-	If we have to rely on online methods of communication then technical difficulties during virtual interviews and problems with recording equipment would become a key issue. To account for this we will conduct technical checks before the scheduled interview. We will also ensure that we are in a location with stable internet and advise the interviewee to do the same. 

4. Create an interview protocol for your project: (Remember: You want to find out what your users do, say, think, and feel)
◦ Minimum of 10 questions
-	We are going to have 21 questions in total. Six of the 21, will be preliminary questions that the interviewee will answer in an online survey before the interview.

◦ Consider the order of the questions
-	The order of questions went from introductory to probing, to more specific questions regarding lifestyle and the types of features the user would want in the app, concluding with some final questions like how useful they would find the app and if there are any additional features they would like after the initial set of questions.

◦ Consider the usefulness of the questions (refer back to the discussion above)
-	The questions start off with simply gathering demographic information. The probing and lifestyle questions will be used to gather information on the participant's current routine and pain points in that routine. The feature questions will collect data on must-have and nice-to-have features. The final questions will provide insight into what the participant would expect the ideal application to have.

◦ Create some probing questions you can use if your interviewee needs a nudge
-	On a typical day, describe your process of selecting your outfit. 
-	How long does it take for you to pick out your outfit?
-	Suppose you’re struggling to select an outfit, how much does it impact your day (e.g. causes you to be late,  negatively impacts your confidence, etc.?
-	How often do you struggle when deciding what to wear in the morning?
-	How much does the weather impact what you decide to wear? 
-	Do you check the weather before or after selecting your outfit? 

5. Create a rough observation plan for your project: (Remember: You want to find out what
your users do, say, think, and feel)
◦ Who would you observe? Why?
-	We would observe the participant's process when picking out their daily outfits. This will allow us to gather information on their daily routine, style, and potential pain points. 

◦ Where would you do the observation? Why? Be specific!
-	Our ideal location would be in the subject’s home to provide us with the most accurate data. If the subject is in their home it is easier to assess their typical routine as they will be more comfortable in their usual environment, making it easier for us to identify overlooked pain points. Our secondary option would be a clothing store as it would allow them to select the clothing items that matter to them the most. 

◦ How long would you observe? Why?
-	We plan to conduct an observation that lasts about 15-30 minutes. This duration was selected to showcase the average time it takes the subject to select an outfit and how many barriers may arise during that process. It ensures that we have a sufficient amount of time to elaborate on a task if needed. 

◦ What tasks would you ask the users to do? Why?
-	Try on different clothing items for different settings (e.g., average day, hot/cold day, for work, etc.). This will help determine their typical thinking process when deciding what to wear, helping us figure out how we’d like the app to work.
-	We would get them to show us 2-4 different clothing items that define their style. This will help us determine how the app would pick out clothing items for the user.
-	Finally, we would get them to explain/show their process of using applications that help them figure out what to wear. This will provide us with vital information on how we want to implement generated outfits in our app, what we can do better and identify potential competitors.

◦ What would you hope to learn?
-	We want to gather information about how the user picks their outfit, the different variables that go into determining that outfit (e.g., style, fashion trends, the weather, the event, etc.), and what other apps they use. We want to learn about the specific pain points that our participants encounter in their current routines to start the process of identifying ways to overcome them. Finally, we also hope to learn about potential competitors or other systems that we may have to integrate into our app. 

◦ Anything else you think would be helpful
-	It would be helpful for the user to actually demonstrate how they use a similar app to pick out what functionalities might be good to include in our app. This is, of course, optional as the user can just explain the process of going through these apps, or provide examples of apps that have the same type of purpose.

Mace’s Observation Responses

1. Get the interviewee to pick an outfit for the day and explain their thought process for picking it out.
Today, I am wearing shorts, a cropped shirt, and a loose undone button up. I decided to wear some lighter accessories, such as simple earrings and a necklace, as well as low cut socks and my stylish Nike shoes. I chose this outfit because I have some errands and cleaning to get done, and the loose, breezy fabric will allow me to stay cool and comfortable while I go through my day! Since it is my day off today, I wanted to accessorize and wear nicer shoes as I usually don't get to with a busy work schedule.

2. Choose an outfit for a warm/cold day and explain why you chose that outfit.
For a colder day, I would choose a pair of jeans, a simple undershirt, a loose hoodie and a flannel to layer on top. I would also choose a pair of Dr. Martens, as they provide warmth and stability. In my mind, the multiple layers on the upper body acts as a jacket, and usually keeps me very warm during fall and early winter. Another jacket would be too much fabric for myself, so I try to layer with style in mind. The boots I chose are a classic, and could compliment any outfit. I usually prefer to wear them in colder seasons, as that's when they perform best.

3. Choose an outfit for a job and explain why you chose it.
For an interview, I always go with darker colours with a pop of color or brightness. I find it draws the eye in more, and people are more inclined to notice me. During an interview, I want to stand out and be memorable. If I had an interview today, I would likely wear a pair of nicer, dark coloured pants, not jeans. Then a simple lighter color (white/light blue) button up shirt with a brown wool blazer.

4. Show me three items (e.g., shirt, pants, shorts, etc.) that best represent your style and explain that style in more detail.
●	Sheer Black Top
I feel this is the most important piece to my style as when I was younger I was afraid to wear clothes like this and I feel it symbolizes personal growth and becoming comfortable with my appearance.
●	Hoodies
Growing up, my mom wore a lot of hoodies and would often lend them to me so it became a personal comfort thing. Hoodies are very versatile in my style as they can be used in laid back outfits as well as more put-together semi-professional outfits.
●	Ripped Jeans
They offer a touch of alternative style to my outfits, they fit looser, more comfortable, and give better circulation. I always wear them with alternative style jewelry and shoes. I feel like I’m missing a part of myself when I don’t have any ripped jeans available. Similar to the sheer black top, to me, they represent freedom of expression and being the person you want to be.

5 .Are there any apps that you use to pick out your clothes? Can you walk me through how you use them?
I don't use any apps to pick outfits but sometimes I use Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration.

Observation

Get the interviewee to pick an outfit for the day and explain their thought process for picking it out.
First I checked to see what pants were clean and decided on a pair of light jeans. Next I checked the temperature for today and since it was going to be warm, I decided to go for just a t-shirt.
Choose an outfit for a warm/cold day and explain why you chose that outfit.
For a colder day I would start the same way with checking my pants, then I would find an overshirt or flannel. Afterwards I would look for a shirt to wear under but usually just choose a plain white undershirt.
Choose an outfit for a job and explain why you chose it.
For a job interview, I would probably go for one of my nicer button-up overshirts done up most of the way along with khakis or dress pants depending on the “fanciness” of the company I’m interviewing for.
Show me three items (e.g., shirt, pants, shorts, etc.) that best represent your style and explain that style in more detail.
●	Orange flannel
●	Denim Jacket
●	Black cargos

-	It would also have a feature to select a set style for certain days of the week (e.g., weekdays = work days so only work appropriate clothing, personal days = weekends so more casual.)
-	Wouldn't want to have clubbing clothes recommended for a Tuesday. 
14. Would you want to see all your clothing items in one place?
-	Would like to have the ability to see their wardrobe or at least most used clothing items, viewable in an app. 
-	Has seen other apps where the user takes photos of their clothes to fill their online store but finds that idea to be tedious.

15. Would you want to have the app display recommended outfits for you right when you open the app, or have it select the best outfits for you based on criteria that you select?
-	Select based on predefined criteria. 
-	They would prefer a system like Pinterest where new accounts are prompted to ask the user for their style preferences/interests and then recommendations are based on that. 
-	Having outfit recommendations that don't match the user's style would have a detrimental effect on the user.
16. Would you want the app to save your favourite outfits?
-	Yes, being able to save outfits is a must, because they don't want to have to reconfigure it constantly. 
-	If there's a way to save outfits and alter generated outfits and then save those then they'd be inclined to purchase items through the app if it linked to different marketplaces
17. Would you want the app to recommend outfits based on past choices, or give you random combinations that you have not tried before?
-	Both, an option to view old outfits and an option to see a completely new selection of clothing combinations. On separate pages. 
-	A favourites tab would be another must-have feature. 
18. Would you want to upload photos of your clothes, or pick them out from a catalog? 
-	Taking photos of all of the clothes in her closet would be a tedious, time consuming chore that may not be possible with her schedule.

-	An online catalog or browser would be the most preferred option. Especially if they were able to add items to their virtual closet while out shopping or during downtime. 
19. Are there any other features or utilities that you would want the app to have?
-	Social media aspect where users can upload and share photos of outfits which can be saved or just share photos of themselves.

-	If it's a purely fashion app then a 4-5, because staying up to date with the latest fashion trends isn't important to her. 
-	If it's a fashion combined with a productivity app where it has the calendar feature to let her plan out her week then an 8-9. 
 
Observation
1. Get the interviewee to pick an outfit for the day and explain their thought process for picking it out.
-	For work: She selected a black pair of slacks and a cream sweater. 
-	She normally goes for darker pants because the kids at her school may touch her with dirty hands so darker clothing is better at combating or obstructing stains. 
-	Typically goes for tops that cover up as much skin as possible to maintain a work appropriate look. Sweaters and blouses are the go-to’s but she'll also wear an undershirt if the top she wants to wear is low-cut. 
-	For weekends/personal days: She selected light blue jeans, a black crop top and a green zip-up hoodie for if it is or gets cold. 
-	If it's for going out then she'd go with a dress or a flower patterned blouse with a low cut. 
2. Choose an outfit for a warm/cold day and explain why you chose that outfit.
-	Cold day: Thicker pants like jeans and a thick forest green sweater. However, she can usually pick whatever since she has a large puffer jacket that can cover her whole body when it's cold. 
-	Warm day: Leggings or light colored jeans with a light shirt, blouse, or crop top.
3. Choose an outfit for a job and explain why you chose it.
-	She'd choose a dress either a satin or floral one. That'd be paired with tights and boots or sneakers since she's not a fan of high heels. 
-	She doesn’t typically wear dresses so when she does it feels different and fun which is why she’ll only wear them during special events.
4. Show me three items (e.g., shirt, pants, shorts, etc.) that best represent your style and explain that style in more detail.
-	Light blue Jeans and a floral blouse or cream sweater. Since living in Europe her ideal styling is more European so if she could get recommendations to implement that here it'd be beneficial. 
5. Are there any apps that you use to pick out your clothes? Can you walk me through how you use them
-	Pinterest and Instagram are the main two apps she uses for selecting her outfit. 
-	Pinterest is the main one as it allows her to search through a catalog of similar clothes (e.g. different types of white shirts) and then allows her to make and save combinations. If she's out and sees a girl with a nice looking fit then she'll go on Pinterest and find the closes thing and then look for a similar item while shopping. 
-	If she checks the weather before selecting an outfit then she'll use the weather app on her phone.
